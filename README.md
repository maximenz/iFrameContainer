# iFrame Container IPX
I have searched the web inside out and found no proper written iFrame code that is reponsive and yet flexibile in wrap, so i have decided to write my own.

Features:<br />
<ul>
<li>Responsive (Mobile, tablet, all devices adaptive)</li>
<li>Full Width</li>
<li>Full Height</li>
<li>No border</li>
<li>No disgusting 'container'</li>
<li>No additional scroll bar like other iFrame code</li>
<li>Works perfectly for PDF document!</li>
</ul><br />
<h1>Demo</h1>

This is exactly how iFrame should have been.
